# HR Case Study: Unraveling the Absenteeism Puzzle for Enhanced Performance

In this HR case study, we delve into the realm of absenteeism to shed light on the factors impacting employee performance within a medium-sized company. As the manager observed a decline in team productivity, a focused investigation led us to the culprit: absenteeism. Our mission was to explore the intricacies of this issue and develop strategies for prevention.

## Anticipated Outcomes:

- Discern trends in absenteeism.
- Identify the root causes behind absenteeism.
- Construct an informative dashboard summarizing our discoveries.
- Present our findings to stakeholders.

## Tools Utilized:

- PowerBI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

- Medical reasons proved to be the predominant cause of absenteeism.
- A startling 70% of unjustified leave was taken by individuals with a penchant for imbibing.
- Absences due to Reason 15 (medical) were disproportionately prevalent on Mondays and Fridays.
