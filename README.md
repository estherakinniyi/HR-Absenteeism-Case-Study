# HR Case Study: Unraveling the Absenteeism Puzzle for Enhanced Performance

In this HR case study, we delve into the realm of absenteeism to shed light on the factors impacting employee performance within a medium-sized company. As the manager observed a decline in team productivity, a focused investigation led us to the culprit: absenteeism. Our mission was to explore the intricacies of this issue and develop strategies for prevention.

## Anticipated Outcomes:

- Discern trends in absenteeism.
- Identify the root causes behind absenteeism.
- Construct an informative dashboard summarizing our discoveries.
- Present our findings to stakeholders.

## Tools Utilized:

- PowerBI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Key Insights and Conclusions:

- Mondays has the hightest absenteeism rate
- Spring exhibited the highest absenteeism rate.
- Coincidentally, Spring also bore the heaviest workload.
- A mere five employees, out of a total of 36, accounted for half of all absences.
- Medical reasons proved to be the predominant cause of absenteeism.
- A startling 70% of unjustified leave was taken by individuals with a penchant for imbibing.
- Absences due to Reason 15 (medical) were disproportionately prevalent on Mondays and Fridays.
- Employees with four children appeared to require more leave compared to those with fewer offspring.
- Curiously, obese employees constituted only a quarter of the workforce but represented a third of all medical leave cases.
- Atleast 95% of employees adhered to disciplinary warnings.

## Recommendations


- Consider redistributing or alleviating the workload during the Spring season.
- Engage and support employees with a high incidence of absenteeism.
- Foster a healthier workplace environment by hosting events promoting well-being and consider office renovations that encourage healthy choices.
